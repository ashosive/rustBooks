<p>To demonstrate a more complex problem with lifetimes, let's consider a mythical bank account:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am given access to a bank account, legally, of course</li>
<li>I decide that I want my friend to have access to it</li>
<li>After a certain amount of time, I decide I no longer want access to the account and have my access removed</li>
<li>My friend then tries to use the account</li>
</ul>
<p>When my friend comes to use the account, he is unable to do so, as the reference I had, and which was passed to him, no longer exists. He is trying to <em>use after free</em>Â (in programming terms) and he is known here as a <strong>dangling reference</strong>.</p>
<p>It sounds far-fetched, but in development terms, it happens far more frequently than you would possibly give credit for.</p>
