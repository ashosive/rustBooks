<p>In this task, you are to take your code and put it into the <kbd>mathslib</kbd> crate. This may not be as simple as it seems. The library will need to take:</p>
<ul>
<li>A filename for the file containing the data</li>
<li>A vector containing either a <kbd>struct</kbd> or <kbd>tuple</kbd> that holds the data</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the problem doesn't lie in the data, but rather in the fact that, each time a calculation is made, the whole regression analysis has to be performed. For example, to calculate the standard deviation, you can't just pass in the results for the equation of a straight lineâ€”that won't work, but will cause the whole calculation to be performed again.</p>
<p>In terms of the speed of a library, this is very inefficient; you should calculate once and be able to draw out all answers from there. In terms of your code, this will require some re-organization.</p>
<p>Once you have done this, you should create the unit tests for each function and test them in your test rig app with both a vector then the filename.</p>
<p>You will need to add the documentation for this task to your current documentation.</p>
