<p>We have seen in this chapter how Rust deals with threading within an application. Be under no illusion of the power threading has and the inherent issues it gives rise to. However, when used correctly, threading can greatly improve the performance of your application. Think of a web browser if you need further proof; imagine the speed of one if everything was performed on a single threadâ€”a simple page could take over a minute to render!</p>
<p>We have also looked at closures and the power behind them. Put the two together and you can appreciate how powerful threading and inline functions can be.</p>
<p>We're taking a break in the next chapter to access how your Rust skills are progressing with another project task that will build upon the ones performed in <span class="ChapterrefPACKT"><a href="24651b17-6de3-4f1a-a182-f90810b48934.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Creating Your Own Rust Applications</em></span>. After that, we'll be concluding the book with a look at the standard libraries and using external libraries to further improve your Rust applications by interfacing with them.</p>
