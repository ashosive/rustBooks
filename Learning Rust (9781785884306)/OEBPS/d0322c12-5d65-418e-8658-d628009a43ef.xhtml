<p>Usually, the use of <kbd>thread::sleep</kbd> allows the execution to pause for a finite amount of time as an extra protection against racing. This is not always a good plan as there isn't any real way to tell how long a thread is going to take, so it's at best a guess. As with all guesses, they can be wildly inaccurate (it is used here as we're not doing anything with the data value).</p>
<p>In real systems, the preferred method, to ensure that the correct amount of time is given to ensure that everything has worked is to synchronize the threads using channels.</p>
