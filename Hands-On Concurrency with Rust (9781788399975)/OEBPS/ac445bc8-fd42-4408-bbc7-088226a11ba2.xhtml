<p>In this last chapter of the book, we discussed near and midterm improvements coming to the Rust languageâ€”features being stabilized after a while out in the wilderness, the foundations of larger projects being integrated, research that may or may not pan out, and other topics. Some of these topics will surely have chapters of their own in the second edition of this book, should it get a new edition (Tell your friends to pick up a copy!). We also touched on the community, which is the place to find ongoing discussions, ask questions, and get involved. Then, we affirmed that, yes indeed, you should write in unsafe Rust when you have reason to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's it. That's the end of the book.</p>
