<p><span>If this is your first Rust programming book, I warmly thank you for your enthusiasm, but encourage you to seek out a suitable introduction to the programming language. This book will hit the ground running, and it will likely not be appropriate if you've got questions about the basics. The Rust community has produced</span><span> </span><em>excellent</em><span> </span><span>documentation, including introductory texts.</span><span> </span>The Book<span> </span><span>(</span><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/</a><span>), first edition, is how many who are already in the community learned the language. The second edition of the book, still in progress at the time of writing, looks to be an improvement over the original text, and it is also recommended. There are many other excellent introductions widely available for purchase, as well.</span></p>
