<p>The focus of 2018's Rust development has been stabilization. Since the 1.0 days in 2015, many important crates were nightly-only, whether because<span>Â of modifications to the compiler or because of the fear of standardizing too quickly on awkward APIs. This fear was reasonable. At the time, Rust was a new language and it changed</span> <em>very</em> <span>drastically in the lead-up to 1.0. A new language takes time to resolve into its natural style. By the end of 2017, the community had come to a general feeling that a stabilization cycle was in order, that some natural expression of the language had more or less been established, and that in areas where this was not true, it could be established, with some work.</span></p>
<p>Let's discuss this stabilization work with regards to the topics we've followed throughout the book.</p>
