<p>As a modern system-level programming language, Rust has to have a good method for executing code concurrently and in parallel on many processors simultaneously. And indeed, it does: Rust provides a wide selection of concurrency and parallel tools. Its type system is strong enough to write concurrency primitives that have properties unlike anything that has existed before. In particular, it can encode a wide selection of memory safe parallel abstractions that are also guaranteed to be data-race free, and no garbage collector is used. This is mind-blowing; no other language can do this. All these features are not ingrained in the language itself, but provided by libraries so that improved or new versions can always be built. Developers should choose the tool that is right for the job at hand, or that can improve on or develop new tools.</p>
<p>We will discuss the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrency and threads</li>
<li>Shared mutable states</li>
<li>Communication through channels</li>
</ul>
