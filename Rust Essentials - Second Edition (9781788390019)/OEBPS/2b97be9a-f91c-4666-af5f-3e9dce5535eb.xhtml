<p>In this chapter, we showed you the richness of the Rust ecosystem, how to search for usable crates, and the most important crates you'll want to use in your development.</p>
<p>This brings us to the end of our Rust journey in this book. We hope you've enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed writing it. You now have a firm basis to start developing in Rust. We also hope that this whirlwind overview has shown you why Rust is a rising star in the software development world, and why you should take it up in your projects. Join the Rust community and start using your coding talents. Perhaps we'll meet again in the Rust (un)iverse.</p>
