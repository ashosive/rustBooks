<p>Dynamic languages such as Ruby or Python give you the initial speed of coding development, but the price is paid later in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing more tests</li>
<li>Runtime crashes</li>
<li>Production outages</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust compiler forces you to get a lot of things right from the beginning at compile time, which is the least expensive place to identify and fix bugs.</p>
<p>Rust's object orientation is not as explicit or evolved as common object-oriented languages such as Java, C# or Python, as it doesn't have classes. Compared with Go, Rust gives you more control over memory and resources and so it lets you code on a lower level. Go also works with a garbage collector; it has no generics and no mechanism to prevent data races between its <kbd>goroutines</kbd> used in concurrency. Julia is focused on numerical computing performance, works with a JIT compiler, and also doesn't give you that low-level control as Rust does.</p>
