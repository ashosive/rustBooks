<p>Consider the following situation.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have inherited legacy code. A previous team responsible for developing privileged access modules for elevators has been moved to a different project. They successfully developed code libraries to interface with a range of microcontrollers. However, while developing the access logic in Rust, they found object ownership to be very complicated and were unable to develop software that was compatible with Rust.</p>
<p>Your task in this chapter will be to analyze their code, look for possible solutions, then create a library to support privileged access for your elevators. To clarify, privileged access refers to override codes and keys made available to emergency services such as police, firemen, and so on.</p>
