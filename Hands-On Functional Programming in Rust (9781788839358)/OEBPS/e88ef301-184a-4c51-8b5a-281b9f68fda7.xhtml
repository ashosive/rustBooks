<p>Reviewing the feedback, it is clear that there are two perspectives that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>A competitor has made specific claims that our company will need to outperformÂ </li>
<li>The client has explicit expectations to address concerns from the first demonstration</li>
</ul>
<p>The specific claims from the competitor can be listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceleration is within comfortable bounds</li>
<li>Velocity is within safe bounds</li>
<li><span>Trip time from any floor to any other floor is within 20% of physical theoretical limits</span></li>
<li>The software is 10% cheaper</li>
</ul>
<p>We will delegate the price negotiation to our sales team, but otherwise we need to adjust our software to outperform the other three claims. If we can meet these requirements and provide adequate supporting evidence, then this should also address most of the client's explicit concerns.</p>
<p>Additionally, the client was specifically concerned about the elevator passing the destination floor and needing to back up. We should address this behavior and confirm that it does not occur in simulations.</p>
<p>It is clear at this point that the previous motor control logic is inadequate. After brainstorming, your team develops two possible improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a variable acceleration/deceleration calculation, rather than on/off adjustment</li>
<li>Reduce the update interval to permit faster and, thus, more precise decisions</li>
</ul>
