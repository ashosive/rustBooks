<p>After an initial demonstration, your team has received comments and feedback from the potential client. Watching the simulation, the elevator seems to often pass and go back up to floors before stopping. The client expressed concern that this would be not only inefficient, but also uncomfortable or irritable for passengers. To win the contract, the client wants to see improvements and evidence showing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ride is comfortable and reliably direct</li>
<li>The ride moves efficiently from each source to each destination floor</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you have learned that a competitor has submitted a separate proposal. The competitor specifically claims that its elevator control system maintains acceleration within comfortable levels, velocity within safe bounds, and reaches destinations accurately within 20% of physical theoretical limits. No specific numbers were provided, and no simulation was demonstrated, but the client seemed very convinced, along with the assurance that the project will cost 10% less.</p>
