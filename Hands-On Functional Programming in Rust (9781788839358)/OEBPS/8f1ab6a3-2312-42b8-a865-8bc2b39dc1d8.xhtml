<p class="mce-root">Thanks for your interest in functional programming in Rust. Rust is a very young programming language and is particularly new to the functional programming community. Despite its age, the language provides a wealth of tools that are both practical and sophisticated.</p>
<p>In this book, we will introduce general functional programming principles and how they apply to Rust specifically. Our goal is to provide knowledge and a perspective on Rust that will outlast small changes to language features. The pace of development of Rust is so fast that during the course of writing the book we introduced new features as they became available and relevant. We want to equip the reader to produce code for this fast-moving environment such that they are prepared to best utilize new features as they are released.</p>
